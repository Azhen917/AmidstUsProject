# Amidst Us Project

You and your group of astronaut friends are on a spaceship! Fun! However, you are not completely sure you can trust some of them... kinda sus... There seems to be a few Impostors onboard, trying to sabotage you and your crew. Your job is to analyze the players and find the impostors before it is too late! 

The crewmates win if all of the impostors are frozen, and the impostors win if they hold a majority of the unfrozen players (greater than or equal to half). 

In this assignment, you will be given a partially filled Player.java (see below for more details), and will create Impostor.java, Crewmate.java, RedAstronaut.java, and BlueAstronaut.java.

These classes will simulate the gameplay. In addition, you will create a Gameplay.java file that will not be turned in, serving as a driver that can be used to test your code and check its output. To complete this assignment, you will use your knowledge of abstract classes and interfaces.
